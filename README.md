# JShell

## Description
A mock Bash shell developed in Java within a team of four using the Agile Scrum methodology.

It incorporates many different Software Design patterns such as the Singleton, Injection, and Composite design pattern.

Object-Oriented principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism were used during the development process to ensure reusable and maintainable code. More specifically, Object-Oriented guidelines such as the Single Responsibility and Liskov Substitution principle were followed.

Testing was done with JUnit.

Version control was done with SVN.
